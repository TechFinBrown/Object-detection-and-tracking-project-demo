# Introduction
This repository  performing the task of implementing a car counter and tracking from an highway traffic video by using Transfer Learning.

---
# Using pre-trained models
- Tensorflowâ€™s Object Detection API provides pre-trained models for object detection, which are capable of detecting around 90 classes (objects) with car being one of the classes.
